# Analyzing-Customer-Churn-and-Retention-Patterns-in-a-UK-Based-Multinational-Retail-Bank

# Overview 

Company Context Veritas Bank, a UK-based retail bank with operations in Germany and France, serves over 3 million customers. Known for technology-driven services, the bank now faces rising churn due to fintech competition, declining engagement in continental Europe, and lack of real-time churn monitoring.

## Business Challenge 

Veritas Bank is facing increased customer churn from its users. Retaining customers has become a growing challenge due to:

- > **Intense competition from neobanks and fintech startups**
 - > **Perceived decrease in customer engagement in Germany and France**
  - >  **Lack of targeted retention strategies based on behavioural insights**

The absence of real-time churn monitoring and customer segmentation has made it difficult for the business to respond
proactively.
