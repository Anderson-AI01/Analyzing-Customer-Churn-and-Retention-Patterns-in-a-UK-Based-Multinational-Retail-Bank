# Analysing-Customer-Churn-and-Retention-Patterns-in-a-UK-Based-Multinational-Retail-Bank

# Overview 

Company Context Veritas Bank, a UK-based retail bank with operations in Germany and France, serves over 3 million customers. Known for technology-driven services, the bank now faces rising churn due to fintech competition, declining engagement in continental Europe, and lack of real-time churn monitoring.

## Business Challenge 

Veritas Bank is facing increased customer churn from its users. Retaining customers has become a growing challenge due to:

- > **Intense competition from neobanks and fintech startups**
 - > **Perceived decrease in customer engagement in Germany and France**
  - >  **Lack of targeted retention strategies based on behavioural insights**

The absence of real-time churn monitoring and customer segmentation has made it difficult for the business to respond
proactively.

## Challenge Faced!

While working on this project, I needed to:
- Store and query large datasets efficiently using **SQL Server**
- Use **Power BI** for visualizations  
- But my main device was a **MacBook (M1)**  which doesn‚Äôt support SQL Server installation natively.

Instead of switching systems, I found a cross-platform solution.

### Running SQL Server on Mac for Data Analysis (M1)

This documents how I overcame the challenge of running **SQL Server** on a **Mac (M1)** while working on a this **project**.  
Since SQL Server isn‚Äôt natively supported on macOS, I used **Docker**, **Azure SQL Edge**, and **Azure Data Studio** to set up a full working environment and then connected it to **Power BI** (on Windows) for visualization.

## My Setup

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| üê≥ **Docker** | To host SQL Server in a container using the Azure SQL Edge image |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **Azure SQL Edge** | Lightweight version of SQL Server that runs on ARM processors |
| üíª **Azure Data Studio** | For database management and SQL queries on Mac |
| üü® **Power BI (Windows)** | For analysis and visualization via remote connection |
